# FAST Timetable

## Introtuction

Fastians must have wanted Timetable Management Team to make easy-to-find class in the big colorful spreadsheet, but from years it has not been setted😫.

So, for the solution I thought to made a Timetable Web & APK, that are easy and convenient to use. In the apk you can view your classes by searching section, course name, course + section and even teacher name. It can also provide specific time classes or specific classroom classes by searching them.
